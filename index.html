            Changes can also be unstaged by clicking the – (minus) button. The equivalent
            command for this action is git reset
            to unstage a single file or git reset to unstage all the files in a directory. You can also choose not to
            stage your modified files by skipping the staging area. In this case, Visual Studio
            allows you to commit your changes directly without having to stage them. Just enter your commit message and
            then
            select Commit All. The equivalent command for this action is git commit -a.
